# ROAD – Road Event Awareness Dataset for Autonomous Driving  
(Academic Major Project)

This repository contains the documentation and exploratory data analysis
work for the ROAD (ROad event Awareness Dataset) project, completed as part
of my B.Tech academic major project.

The primary focus of this project is system design, dataset understanding,
and event-awareness concepts for autonomous driving, supported by
lightweight baseline machine learning experiments.

## Project Overview
Autonomous driving systems require awareness of dynamic road events such as
lane changes, braking, overtaking, turning, and stopping. The ROAD dataset
captures such events using annotated data involving agents, actions, and
locations.

This project focuses on:
- Understanding road-event datasets used in autonomous driving
- Designing system architecture and data flow for event awareness
- Performing exploratory data analysis and baseline ML experiments

## Repository Contents
- **docs/**  
  Academic project documentation including system study, data flow
  diagrams, module descriptions, and final reports.

- **notebooks/**  
  Exploratory Jupyter notebook demonstrating data preprocessing,
  visualization, and baseline machine learning models.

- **data/**  
  Sample / anonymized annotation data used for demonstration purposes.

## Dataset Note
The complete ROAD dataset is not included in this repository due to its
large size and licensing constraints. A small sample dataset is provided
to demonstrate the data analysis and modeling workflow.

---

## Exploratory Models Used
The following baseline machine learning algorithms are implemented for
learning and experimentation:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

These models are used to understand event patterns and feature behavior,
not for full-scale production deployment.

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Understanding of real-world autonomous driving datasets
- Ability to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Application of basic machine learning algorithms
- Strong system-level thinking and technical documentation

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
